# ElevenLabs API Key Setup

Guide the user through obtaining and configuring an ElevenLabs API key.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Check for an existing API key first

Before asking the user for a key, check for an existing `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`:

1. Check whether `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` exists in the current environment.
2. If it's not in the environment, check `.env` for `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=<value>`.
3. If an existing key is found, **validate it**:
   ```
   GET https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/user
   Header: xi-api-key: <existing-api-key>
   ```
4. **If existing key validation succeeds:**
   - Tell the user ElevenLabs is already configured and working
   - Skip the setup flow
   - Ask whether they want to replace/rotate the key; if not, stop
5. **If existing key validation fails:**
   - Tell the user the existing key appears invalid or expired
   - Continue to Step 1

### Step 1: Request the API key

Tell the user:

> To set up ElevenLabs, open the API keys page: https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys
>
> (Need an account? Create one at https://elevenlabs.io/app/sign-up first)
>
> If you don't have an API key yet:
> 1. Click "Create key"
> 2. Name it (or use the default)
> 3. Set permission for your key. If you provide a key with "User" permission set to "Read" this skill will automatically verify if your key works
> 4. Click "Create key" to confirm
> 5. **Copy the key immediately** - it's only shown once!
>
> Paste your API key here when ready.

For service account keys, optionally restrict usage to trusted IP addresses or CIDR ranges with
`allowed_ips`. Omitting it or setting it to `null` allows all IPs; when editing a service account
key, use `clear` to remove the allowlist or omit the field to leave it unchanged.

Then wait for the user's next message which should contain the API key.

### Step 2: Validate and configure

Once the user provides the API key:

1. **Validate the key** by making a request:
   ```
   GET https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/user
   Header: xi-api-key: <the-api-key>
   ```

2. **If validation fails:**
   - Tell the user the API key appears to be invalid
   - Ask them to try again
   - Remind them of the URL: https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys
   - If it fails a second time, display an error and exit

3. **If validation succeeds**, save the API key in a `.env` file:
   ```
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=<the-api-key>
   ```
   - If `.env` already has `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...`, replace that line
   - Otherwise add a new line for `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`

4. **Confirm success:**
   > Done! Your key is stored as an environment variable in .env
   > Keep the key safe! Don't share it with anyone!
